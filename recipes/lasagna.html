    <h2>Description</h2> 

    <p>this classic lasagna recipe, 
    sheets of pasta are layered with a cheesy filling,
    a rich meaty tomato sauce, and more cheese and then 
    baked until bubbly and browned.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

     <ul>
        <li><strong>Cheese Filling</strong>: For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and parmesan with seasonings.</li>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong>: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor.</li>
        <li>To keep this sauce quick, I use <strong>pasta sauce or marinara sauce</strong> (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer)</li>
        <li><strong>Spinach</strong> is optional but delicious in lasagna. For spinach lasagna, thaw 10oz of frozen spinach, squeeze out the moisture, and add it along with the cheese layer.</li>
     </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
     <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil pasta</strong>: In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare meat sauce</strong>: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine cheese mixture</strong>: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Layer & bake</strong>: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.</li>
            
     </ol>
